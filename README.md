# Dynamic Array Data Structures Assignment

A dynammic array is a relatively straightforward data structure that can add input to the end of the array and grow as needed
in order to take in the the data. Array overflows are a serious problem for computer security. A simple solution is to implement
a dynamic array. Some small recommendations that could make this even more feasible to make available for everyday use in a C
program:

  * Define a character pointer in a stuct type definition
  * Define a `push` function which takes in a dynamic array and a character and does all of the necessary work there
